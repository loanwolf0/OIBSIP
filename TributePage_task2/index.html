      <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died
        April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who
        developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the
        Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric
        effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist
        of the 20th century.
      </p>

      <h1>Childhood and Education</h1>
      <p>
        Einstein was born in Ulm, a city in the German Empire, on March 14th,
        1879, to a family of Ashkenazi Jews. Since childhood, he was always
        interested in the subject of science. He often recalls how certain
        events in his early childhood days were pretty significant in his
        interest in science. At age 5, he was introduced to a compass and
        mesmerized by its deflecting needle. At age 12, he was interested in
        Geometry. These were the stepping stones to his intrigue in the subject.
        He even named his favorite book the "sacred little geometry book." As a
        child, his tutor, Max Talmey, was one of the most important influences.
        He introduced him to higher mathematics & philosophy. He was great at
        Math and Physics from a very young age, which led him to believe that we
        can understand any concept in our nature as a "mathematical structure."
        He started to teach himself these concepts and, after a point, said, "I
        have learned all the maths they teach at school and a bit more." For
        Einstein, understanding the concepts and reasoning behind the various
        phenomena was more critical than learning the dates of those said
        phenomena.
      </p>

      <h1>Inventions</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a list of some of his well-known inventions and discoveries:
      </p>
      <p>1. General relativity</p>
      <p>2. Special relativity</p>
      <p>3. Photoelectric Effect</p>
      <p>4. Theory of Brownian movement</p>
      <p>5. Mass and energy equivalence, E = mc²</p>
      <p>6. Planck-Einstein relation, E = hf</p>
      <p>7. Einstein-Rosen bridge</p>
      <p>8. Bose-Einstein condensate</p>
      <p>9. Bose-Einstein statistics</p>
      <p>10. Gravitational-wave</p>

      <h1>Why did Albert Einstein win a Nobel Prize?</h1>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein has contributed a lot to the field of science. The
        numerous theories he gave provided revolutionary discoveries in the
        field of modern physics. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for his
        work on the Photoelectric Effect in 1921. As declared by The Nobel
        Committee, he was awarded this prize "for his services to Theoretical
        Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
        photoelectric effect." The Photoelectric Effect happens when electrons
        are emitted due to electromagnetic radiation, for example, light hitting
        a material. When the electrons are emitted in this way, they are known
        as photoelectrons. Einstein presented his Nobel speech on 11th July 1923
        in Gothenburg, as he was not able to attend the Award Ceremony a year
        before in Stockholm.
